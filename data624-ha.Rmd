### 2.3

#### a
![](./week1/2.3a.png)

```{r}
retailData <-  readxl::read_excel('./week1/retail.xlsx', skip=1)
```



#### b
![](./week1/2.3b.png)

```{r}
myts <- ts(retailData[, "A3349338X"],
           frequency = 12,
           start=c(1982,4))
```



#### c
![](./week1/2.3c.png)

```{r}
autoplot(myts[, "A3349338X"]) +
  ggtitle("Time Series Plot A3349338X") +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Value")
```

From the time series plot, we able to deduce:
* Trend: there is a clear upward trend over the duration of the time series

```{r}
ggseasonplot(myts, year.labels = T) +
  ggtitle("Seasonal plot: A3349338X")

ggsubseriesplot(myts) +
  ggtitle("Seasonal subseries pllot: A3349338X")
```

From the seasonal plot,  we are able to deduce:
* Seasonality: there is some clear seasonality that exists among different month, however it is not without minor variation/deviation between the years
* December shows a clear uptick while February shows a clear downtick

```{r}
ggAcf(myts)
```

From the Acf plot, we are able to confirm:
* Trend: the autocorrelations are slowly decreasing as the lags are increasing

Conclusion:
* Trend exists in this time series and is slowly going upwrd
* Seasonality appears to exist however there are years that defy seasonality patterns
* There does not appear to be any cyclic behavior

### 2.7
![](./week1/2.7.png)

```{r}
arrivals <- data("arrivals")
```

```{r}
autoplot(arrivals) +
  ggtitle("Arrivals Time Series") +
  facet_wrap(~series)
```

Observations:
* Japan seems to experience a an upward trend, reach an apex, and then experience a downward trend
* NZ, UK, and US all experience upward trends in arrivals albeit to different degrees
* UK appears to have the greatest variance in their arrival figures
* US has very little deviation in their arrival trend
* NZ has more fluctuation than US, but less than UK in their arrivals
* US on average has the lowest amount of arrivals

```{r}
genSeasonPlot <- function(country) {
  ggseasonplot(arrivals[, country]) +
    ggtitle(glue("Season Plot: {country}"))
}

countries <- c("Japan", "NZ", "US", "UK")
countries %>%
  map(~ genSeasonPlot(.x))
```

Observations from Seasonal Plots:
* Typically the countries will see their highest arrivals in Q3, however the UK appears to go against this seasonal pattern
* Q2 appears to be a down quarter for all countries except NZ
* Q1 is a low point for NZ, and generally a high point for the other countries

```{r}
genSubSeasonPlot <- function(country) {
  ggsubseriesplot(arrivals[, country]) +
    ggtitle(glue("Subseries Plot: {country}"))
}

countries %>%
  map(~ genSubSeasonPlot(.x))
```

Observations:
* Japan's mean stays relatively flat across the quarters outside of Q2
* US also remains relatively consistent and further backs up the lack of deviation point made earlier
* UK experiences the most arrivals in Q1 and A4



### 2.10
![](./week1/2.10.png)

```{r}
data("dj")
ddj <- diff(dj)
```

```{r}
autoplot(ddj)
```

The autoplot appears to show random variation with peaks and valleys 


```{r}
ggAcf(ddj)
```

The changes in the Dow Jones Index do appear to be white noise as the the autocorrelations are very close to zero

### 3.1
![](./week1/3.1.png)

#### usnetelec
```{r}
data("usnetelec")
lambda <- BoxCox.lambda(usnetelec) %>%
  print()

autoplot(BoxCox(usnetelec, lambda))
```


#### usgdp
```{r}
data("usgdp")

lambda <- BoxCox.lambda(usgdp) %>%
  print()

autoplot(BoxCox(usgdp, lambda))
```


#### mcopper
```{r}
data("mcopper")

lambda <- BoxCox.lambda(mcopper) %>%
  print()

autoplot(BoxCox(mcopper, lambda))
```


#### enplanements
```{r}
data("enplanements")

lambda <- BoxCox.lambda(enplanements) %>%
  print()

autoplot(BoxCox(enplanements, lambda))
```


### 3.8
![](./week1/3.8.png)

#### a
![](./week1/3.8a.png)

```{r}
myts.train <- window(myts, end=c(2010,12))
myts.test <- window(myts, start=2011)
```

#### b
![](./week1/3.8b.png)

```{r}
autoplot(myts) +
  autolayer(myts.train, series="Training") +
  autolayer(myts.test, series="Test")
```

The autoplot shows that the data has been correctly split with the latter part of the data reservered for testing

#### c
![](./week1/3.8c.png)

```{r}
fc <- snaive(myts.train)

print(fc)
```

#### d
![](./week1/3.8d.png)

```{r}
accuracy(fc, myts.test)
```

Conclusions:
* The MASE shows that the seasonal naive method does produce a better forecast than the average naive forecast although very slightly. The MASE is only .95
* The MAPE shows that there is about a 9% error in the forecast on average which is not bad, but does show tht it could be improved
* The RMSE and MAE both show that it is possible to improve the forecast but the seasonal naive forecast does do a decent job

#### e
![](./week1/3.8e.png)

```{r}
checkresiduals(fc)
```

The residual diagnostics show:
* An approximately normal distribution
* The mean of the residuals is close to 0
* The residual variance appears to be contant
* The residuals appear to be correlated as the lags near to each other are similar in direction and size
* Although the residuals pass the diagnostic tests, it does still show that the prediction intervals may be inaccurate
* The Box-Ljung test does show a very small p-value which means the residuals are distinguishable from a white noise series. The Q* value is also very large

#### f

Accuracy measures are very sensitive to the training/test split. Forecasts by definition need historical data. The more information present to forecast on, the better the forecast
